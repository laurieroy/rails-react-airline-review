# Open-Flights

This is an airline review site. User can review an airline, by stars and comments. Stars are averaged. 

Tech Used:
- React for the Front end
- Rails for the backend
- PG for the db

- jsonapi-serializer

The initial site is based on a [code-along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyjzi837wME&t=134s) by zayneio. I used jsonapi-serializer instead of fast JSON api since it's depricated.
